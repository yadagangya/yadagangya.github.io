On September 19th, Baidu officially launched China's first "industry-level" medical large model, known as the "Lingyi Large Model."

During the launch event, Baidu announced the opening of testing and trial usage of the Lingyi Large Model to various sectors within the health industry, thereby advancing the digitization and intelligence of the healthcare sector.

He Mingke, Senior Vice President of Baidu Group and President of the Big Health Business Group, stated that the Lingyi Large Model has already engaged in commercial collaborations with numerous clients, resulting in the co-creation of valuable applications. It is dedicated to helping clients improve operational efficiency and drive business growth.

The Lingyi Large Model is the first "industry-level" medical large model in China and the first to achieve commercialization in the medical field. It has already established partnerships with companies such as Gushengtang and Zero Hypothesis and is available for testing to over 200 medical institutions, including public hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, internet healthcare platforms, and chain pharmacies. The model offers Lite, flagship, and customized versions to cater to various needs and application scenarios. Partners can utilize the model's capabilities through APIs or integrate them into existing product systems as plugins to create AI-native applications.

Liu Junwei, General Manager of the AI Industry Department at Baidu's Big Health Business Group, emphasized the need for industry-level large models to cover the entire healthcare industry chain, including public hospitals, research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, internet healthcare platforms, and more.

Representatives from the medical and pharmaceutical industry, such as Peking University School of Stomatology, Beijing Renwei Zhishu Technology, and Health Road, discussed their collaborations with Baidu's Lingyi Large Model during the event. They explored various scenarios, from co-building specialized models to integrating technical capabilities into upper-level application services, highlighting the model's potential to empower diverse industry clients.

Liu Junwei further mentioned that the Lingyi Large Model aims to create a multi-layered product system native to AI. Leveraging data pre-training and fine-tuning, this model offers robust openness, enabling ecosystem partners to make API calls and integrate plugin capabilities to provide comprehensive services to end-users.

By opening testing opportunities to the upstream and downstream sectors of the healthcare industry, Baidu aims to enhance the quality and efficiency of medical services. The Lingyi Large Model focuses on three main areas: intelligent health managers, intelligent medical assistant doctors, and intelligent enterprise services, offering AI-native applications for patients, hospitals, and businesses.

The Lingyi Large Model can generate structured medical records from free text within seconds, analyze patient-doctor dialogues to generate accurate medical histories and chief complaints, and support intelligent question-answering based on multiple Chinese and English documents simultaneously. In terms of assisting diagnosis and treatment, it can help doctors understand patients' conditions through multi-turn dialogues, offer real-time assistance in disease diagnosis, recommend treatment plans, and improve the efficiency and overall experience of the entire medical process. It also acts as a 24-hour "healthcare manager" for patients, providing intelligent customer service. Additionally, the model provides various capabilities for pharmaceutical companies, including professional training and medical information support.

The Lingyi Large Model has a significant advantage due to Baidu's extensive experience and leadership in AI technology. It boasts a wealth of data and a robust technical foundation, making it a leader in the industry. In terms of data, the model focuses on "evidence-based AI empowering the big health industry," ensuring the accuracy and reliability of medical data. It continuously incorporates Baidu's comprehensive healthcare data and authoritative medical knowledge, covering various scenarios, including de-identified medical records from offline clinical settings, literature guidelines, medical knowledge graphs, online popular science knowledge, healthcare dictionaries, health consultation data, and global pharmaceutical and medical device data. High-quality training data ensures traceable answers from the large model.

Regarding technical capabilities, the Lingyi Large Model, built on Baidu's Wenxin Large Model 3.5, achieved the highest scores in seven out of twelve indicators, as reported by IDC in their "AI Large Model Technical Capability Evaluation Report 2023." It secured the top spot in comprehensive ratings, algorithm models, and industry coverage, showcasing the depth of Baidu's foundational technology and the breadth of its industrial applications.

Before its launch, the Lingyi Large Model underwent rigorous evaluations. Over a hundred top-tier physicians evaluated various large model products available in the market across dimensions such as safety, correctness, logic, comprehension, and completeness. The Lingyi Large Model excelled in multiple dimensions compared to similar models.

In summary, Baidu's Lingyi Large Model represents a significant advancement in the medical AI field, offering a comprehensive and industry-focused solution to enhance healthcare services across the board.

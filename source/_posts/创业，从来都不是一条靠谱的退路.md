"I can't take it anymore," said Lao Wang.

Who is Lao Wang? He is a white-collar worker in a big company. Lao Wang has always been a diligent and good employee, although he hasn't had an easy time, he hasn't encountered any major setbacks either. However, the bad work atmosphere and increasing life pressure gradually made Lao Wang feel suffocated.

Especially in recent years, Lao Wang has increasingly felt that he is unable to keep up.

Looking at his work, his age is increasing day by day, and in the eyes of his superiors, he is no longer as good as young people. Promotion is basically at its limit, and it is difficult to climb any higher. The treatment is not good either, not only suffering from injustice, but also working overtime day and night.

Looking at his life, he has elderly parents to support, children to educate, a mortgage to repay, and a precarious future to face. If he doesn't find another way out, he really can't take it anymore.

"Ah, let's start a business. At least life and death are in my own hands, which is better than suffering like this." Lao Wang said. But what should I do? Which industries are easier to enter? Where can I find my own opportunities? Can you give me some advice, Mr. Run?

Coincidentally, before Lao Wang came to see me, I was looking at a set of data. So I told Lao Wang that I didn't have any special advice. My only advice is: think carefully, think carefully, and think again!

Entrepreneurship has never been a reliable way out.

Today's contemplation is for Lao Wang and for you who are already starting a business or preparing to start one because you are dissatisfied with your current situation.

Where do we begin?

Let's start with the set of data I'm currently looking at.

## One, a set of data

So, what kind of data made me hesitate three times in a row?

Guess what, what is the average lifespan of Chinese enterprises?

10 years? 8 years? 5 years?

None of them are correct.

According to a sampling survey by Fortune magazine, the average lifespan of Chinese enterprises is only 3.7 years. Among them, the average lifespan of large enterprises is 7-8 years. The average lifespan of small and medium-sized enterprises is only 2.5 years.

Oh my god. It's hard to imagine that so many companies we are witnessing will disappear without a trace in two or three years.

So, what kind of level is this data of the average lifespan of Chinese enterprises in the world?

Let's take a look at the United States and Japan, which are also in Asia.

In the United States, the average lifespan of small and medium-sized enterprises is about 8.2 years. What about Japan? Japan is longer, about 12.5 years. More exaggeratedly, the average lifespan of large enterprises in Europe and America is as long as 40 years, and the data of large enterprises in Japan reaches a terrifying 58 years.

Compared with Europe, America, and Japan, the average lifespan of Chinese enterprises is much shorter.

But why is this? Are we not smart enough? Are we not diligent enough? Of course not. In terms of intelligence and diligence, if Chinese people rank second, I'm afraid no one dares to rank first.

The lifespan of an enterprise is related to many factors. There are external and internal ones. Some are controllable, and some are uncontrollable. However, there is such a critical factor that Chinese enterprises are "far ahead". That is: **the proportion of passive entrepreneurship**.

**In China's huge entrepreneurial team, the number of passive entrepreneurs accounts for a much higher proportion of the total number of entrepreneurs than in Europe, America, and Japan.**

What is passive entrepreneurship?

Let me give you an example.

Six years ago, a classmate once asked me such a question. To this day, I still remember this question vividly.

He said, "Run, I am a civil servant in a prefecture-level city in Shanxi. I have been working for six years and I am very, very tired of my current job. But I can't make up my mind to resign and start a business. What should I do?"

To be honest, every time I hear such questions, I hesitate whether to answer or not.

Why?

Because when I see such questions, my basic feeling is: this is not thinking about the future at all, but dissatisfaction with today.

Working is really tiring, so I want to start a business. The boss is really stupid, so I want to start a business. The income is really low, so I want to start a business. In short, I am unhappy now, so I want to start a business.

It's not actively "choosing" entrepreneurship, but passively "retreating" to entrepreneurship.

This is passive entrepreneurship.

However, since there is already dissatisfaction with today's situation, should we start a business?

Absolutely not. The reason for starting a business cannot be because today is not going well. If things are not going well and you still want to start a business, it will be even harder. **Usually, successful entrepreneurs have already done their previous jobs very well**.

Therefore, do not start a business just because the current situation is not good.

However, many entrepreneurs today are in the state of "starting a business because of dissatisfaction."

According to a survey report from Tsinghua University, the success rate of passive entrepreneurship is less than 2%.

So, remember two things.

1. Do not start a business just because you are dissatisfied with the current situation.
2. You should not "fall back" into entrepreneurship passively, but should actively "choose" to start a business.

## Two, a story

It's not about passively "falling back" into entrepreneurship, but actively "choosing" entrepreneurship.

I understand.

But how do you know if you are actively choosing entrepreneurship?

Let me share a story with you.

A friend of mine did something that really impressed me.

Once, he went to a coffee shop that was about to close, and the staff had already started cleaning up. At this point, he saw the staff taking out the unsold bread from the cabinet, ready to throw it in the trash.

He said, "Why throw it away? That's too wasteful."

But the staff told him that they had a commitment to consumers and only sold fresh bread that day. So, the unsold bread had to be disposed of.

That made sense. But it was still too wasteful. So why not sell it to me at a discount since you're going to throw it away anyway? You won't waste anything, and I can buy bread at a lower price. This is beneficial for both of us.

So what happened?

The staff told him, "I'm sorry, sir. Our cash register system doesn't have a discount option. You can either buy it at full price or I will have to dispose of it."

What? That's so unreasonable. Can't we be flexible?

Well, it was this kind of inflexibility that made my friend keenly aware of an opportunity, an opportunity in the "near-expiration food" market.

If a loaf of bread costs 10 yuan and the coffee shop sells it for 20 yuan, why not sell it for 15 yuan, 14 yuan, or even cheaper before closing? This way, the coffee shop can recover its costs, consumers can benefit, and as a platform, he can earn a little bit as well.

So he created an app himself and chose this entrepreneurial opportunity with this new business model.

He found a pain point and had the ability to creatively solve this pain point in a more efficient way than others, which of course made it easier for him to succeed. Now his company is a top player in this market and is still growing rapidly.

So how do you know if you are actively choosing entrepreneurship?

It's when you creatively find a way to bring benefits to consumers that they haven't enjoyed before.

If something used to cost them 7 yuan and I can sell it to them for 6 yuan today and still make money, then that's when I can start a business. If what they used to buy was not good enough, but I can give them something better at the same price today, then that's when I can start a business.

If you don't start from this point, can you still start a business?

Of course, you can start a business, but you will find that your potential is very poor. You have not brought benefits to consumers, and no one is willing to help you. You will feel very, very difficult. You have to eat with salespeople every day and talk to customers about business. It is also difficult to collect payments, and so on.

If you continue in this state, it will be really difficult to survive for a long time.

Therefore, in the final analysis, it is still the sentence we repeatedly say.

**The starting point of entrepreneurship must be benefiting consumers.**

## Three, Three Suggestions

The starting point of entrepreneurship must be benefiting consumers.

I understand.

But how can I do it? And how do I know if I have the ability to benefit consumers?

I have three important suggestions for you to consider.

### 1. Have an unbiased self-awareness

Choices are important. Opportunities are also important. But do we really have the ability and level to make brave choices and seize fleeting opportunities?

Many times, we think we can, but in reality, we cannot.

There is a very interesting experiment where each family member talks about how much housework they do. You can try it too.

Perhaps you will find that mom will say she definitely does the most, at least 10 things. Dad will say he doesn't do as much as mom, but probably around 4-5 things. The child will say they also helped, with 3 things. Grandparents will say they don't remember clearly, but they definitely did some.

But at this point, if you add them up, you will find that there are not 20 household chores in the house, it's exceeded, right?

We are all very easy to overestimate our abilities and contributions. Therefore, we must have an unbiased self-awareness.

But how to achieve this "unbiased" self-awareness?

See the picture.

You may have seen this picture before, it's called "The Johari Window".

Everyone has four parts to their self: the public self, the blind self, the secret self, and the unknown self. To have an unbiased self-awareness, the most important part to explore is the "blind self", which is what others know about you but you don't know about yourself.

Therefore, when you want to start a business, change careers, or make a major decision, it's important to listen to others' opinions, especially those that are relatively negative.

Honest advice is almost always unpleasant because it's likely to break your pre-existing beliefs. But it's an important mirror.

Treasure it, don't avoid it.

### 2. Always think about things that are 10 times better

Many people want to start their own business to have a better life. In plain language, they want to earn more than they currently do.

But how much more? 20%? 30%?

That may not be enough. If you have more ability, you should think about strategies that are 10 times better.

Note that this 10 times is not about earning 10 times more tomorrow than you did today. Instead, it means that you should not confine yourself to linear thinking and should instead think of more ambitious, innovative, and exponential methods.

Otherwise, after choosing to start a business, you will find that the competition and pressure you face when thinking about a 20% growth will far exceed what you faced as an employee.

In terms of implementation, you can try to follow Google's approach. Google allows its engineers to spend 20% of their spare time studying their own projects, thinking about personal problems, and doing things they are interested in.

You should do the same.

In addition to your regular work, you must set aside dedicated time to think about the choices you may make.

Some problems may not be clear to you now, but they will be even less clear when the time comes.

### 3. Deeply understand scarcity and the flow of scarcity.

You must find ways to make yourself scarce.

For example, you may eat a bowl of noodles at home for 20 yuan. But when you go to the airport, you find that it costs 100 yuan for a bowl. The price is outrageous. However, the extra money you spend doesn't all go into the merchant's pocket. It's not that the merchant is cheating you, but rather the airport's rent is too high. Most of the extra money goes to the airport.

But can the airport afford to not charge such high rent? It doesn't matter if they don't, because there are plenty of people who want to open a store there. Luxury goods stores, new energy vehicle showrooms, souvenir shops are all fighting for space.

Supply and demand determine airport rent. The airport is scarcer in this regard, so it makes more money.

However, scarcity can flow.

Let me give you a more intuitive example.

Everyone is doing live streaming now, so who do you think is scarce?

At the beginning, when no one knew how to do it, the person who could live stream was valuable.

But now that many people have entered the market, the streamers can train and produce in batches. Those who teach live streaming may make money.

Later on, there are also more MCN agencies, and people realize that the products sold by streamers are the key. Whoever can control the supply chain and deliver good products will make money. The ability to manage the supply chain becomes a scarce ability.

Scarcity is constantly flowing.

You must understand scarcity, establish scarcity, and become scarce.

Only then will your thinking be broader and your choices wider.

## 4. Final Words

Entrepreneurship is very glamorous.

There are always people who strategize and achieve success.

Entrepreneurship is also very challenging.

One wrong move on the battlefield can result in complete failure.

However, regardless of the challenges, entrepreneurship will always be a "choice" rather than a "fallback".

Settling for less will not lead to the desired outcome.

The only reason to make a choice is if we can solve problems better than others.

This requires unbiased self-awareness, continual consideration of 10 times better solutions, and understanding of scarcity and its fluidity.

Then, when opportunities arise, we must bravely make a choice.

Entrepreneurship has never been a reliable fallback.

Do you agree?

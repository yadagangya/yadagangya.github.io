Predicting the next big winner in the Chinese venture capital landscape is challenging due to the dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of the industry. However, several factors and trends may influence the future success of venture capital firms in China:

1. **Technology Innovation**: Firms that focus on investing in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, biotechnology, and clean energy are well-positioned to thrive as these sectors continue to grow.

2. **Consumer Technology**: The Chinese consumer market is vast and diverse. Venture capital firms targeting innovations in e-commerce, fintech, health tech, and entertainment tech could see significant returns.

3. **Green Technology**: As China seeks to address environmental challenges, venture capital firms investing in green and sustainable technologies, such as renewable energy and electric vehicles, may find success.

4. **Global Expansion**: Firms with a global outlook and the ability to help Chinese startups expand internationally can capitalize on China's role as a global economic powerhouse.

5. **Government Initiatives**: Staying aligned with government priorities and benefiting from policies that support innovation and entrepreneurship can be advantageous.

6. **Entrepreneurial Talent**: Firms that can identify and nurture talented entrepreneurs are more likely to succeed. Building strong networks and providing value beyond just funding is crucial.

7. **Adaptability**: The ability to adapt to changing market conditions and emerging technologies is vital for long-term success in the venture capital landscape.

8. **Cybersecurity**: With the increasing importance of data security, firms investing in cybersecurity startups could also see substantial growth.

9. **Healthcare and Biotech**: China's aging population and growing healthcare needs make the healthcare and biotech sectors promising areas for investment.

10. **Education Technology**: As online education and edtech continue to gain momentum, venture capital firms focusing on this sector may thrive.

It's important to note that success in venture capital often depends on a combination of factors, including timing, networking, and the ability to identify disruptive opportunities. Moreover, the regulatory environment and economic conditions can play a significant role. As such, while there are opportunities for big winners in Chinese venture capital, there are also inherent risks, and outcomes can be unpredictable.


In 1993, IDG invested $20 million in cooperation with the Shanghai Science and Technology Commission to establish China's first joint venture technology venture company. If we calculate from this point in time, venture capital has been in China for exactly 30 years.

Since the entry of venture capital into China, entrepreneurs and investors have mutually contributed to creating wealth through numerous success stories. From the internet to mobile internet, and now to AI and hardcore technology, venture capital has played a pivotal role in supporting China's tech ecosystem. Companies like Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Meituan, ByteDance, and various GPT models have emerged with the backing of venture capital.

The role of the capital market is to price assets, optimizing resource allocation. Visionary investors in China have used their capital to vote for the smartest and most promising startups. They have played a crucial role in nurturing the country's innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem.

DEMO originated in Silicon Valley and serves as an international platform for the launch of innovative technologies, products, and business models. Since its inception in 1990, DEMO has propelled star companies and products like Tivo, Palm, Pilot, Java, Skype, and many more onto the global stage.

DEMO CHINA was introduced to China in 2006 by IDG USA and is organized by Chuangyebang. It has grown into China's largest Demo Day, featuring over 200 groundbreaking tech innovation companies and 200 top investment institutions annually. DEMO CHINA brings together over a thousand investors and entrepreneurs for on-site interactions.

Over the past 16 years, more than 45,000 projects have participated in DEMO CHINA, nearly 2,000 companies have taken the stage, and more than 200 star companies have emerged. These include companies that have successfully gone public, such as Zhongwen Online, Getui (Everyday Interaction), English First (EF), and Manbang Group, as well as unicorn companies like Bohai Health, EcoFlow, and DaGuan Data.

The history of DEMO CHINA reflects the development of venture capital in China over the last 16 years. In 2023, as China faces macro challenges like technological cycle shifts, changing global dynamics, and economic growth slowdown, the investment landscape is undergoing adjustments, transformations, and uncertainties. US dollar-based funds are shifting, renminbi-based funds are taking the lead, and the technology cycle is transitioning to AI, AIGC, intelligent manufacturing, new energy, and biotechnology.

With a broader historical perspective, 2023 may be nurturing the next wave of technological change and capital transition. AI is poised to change the world, import substitution is extending beyond bottleneck areas, and the renminbi is set to replace the dollar as a leading investment currency.

China's venture capital landscape has evolved significantly since its inception 30 years ago. Venture capitalists have had to adapt to changing dynamics, shift their investment focus, and navigate new challenges and opportunities. Despite the changes and uncertainties, there is confidence that China's venture capital industry will continue to grow stronger.

In the early years of China's venture capital history, there were several pivotal moments, including IDG's establishment of a venture capital fund in China in 1993, the entry of top US venture capital firms in the mid-2000s, and the founding of domestic venture capital institutions. These milestones laid the foundation for China's vibrant tech ecosystem.

In recent years, there has been a noticeable concentration of capital among well-branded and distinctive venture capital firms. The "80-20 rule" has become more apparent, with funds flowing towards institutions with strong brands and unique investment strategies. This shift has led to both the emergence of new players and the exit of some established firms from the industry.

2023 marks a turning point, with a focus on hardcore technology sectors such as AIGC, new energy and green economy, intelligent manufacturing, new business models, and life sciences. The theme of the conference is "AI Takeover," highlighting the transformative power of AI in various industries.

Unlike the era when single projects could yield hundreds of times returns, the current landscape for hardcore technology projects is characterized by slower growth and lower return multiples. Investing in these areas requires specialized expertise and a longer investment horizon.

With the growing number of institutions entering the hardcore technology space, project valuations have risen, but this trend also provides early-stage investors with opportunities for phased exits.

In terms of fundraising, US dollar-based funds are facing challenges, while renminbi-based funds have become dominant. Government agencies, state-owned enterprises, and government-guided funds represent a significant portion of renminbi-based fund investors.

Exit strategies for Chinese venture capital have primarily involved IPOs, and this trend is expected to continue. However, there is an anticipation of increased merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in China's tech sector, with corporate venture capital (CVC) playing a pivotal role in facilitating M&A deals.

In conclusion, the past 30 years of venture capital in China have witnessed significant transformations and milestones. The industry has evolved from its early days, marked by IDG's pioneering efforts, to a dynamic and competitive landscape where both domestic and international players have contributed to China's tech success. The future holds promise and challenges, with a focus on hardcore technology sectors and the continued growth and maturation of China's venture capital industry.

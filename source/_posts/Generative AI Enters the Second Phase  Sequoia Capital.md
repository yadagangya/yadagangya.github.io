Sequoia Capital is a renowned venture capital firm that invests in innovative companies and technologies. In this context, the phrase likely refers to the evolution or advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and their growing importance in various industries. The "second phase" suggests a new stage of development or application for generative AI, indicating that it has progressed beyond its initial stages and is now entering a more mature and impactful phase in its development and adoption.


The original authors of this article are Sequoia Capital's two partners, Sonya Huang and Pat Grady, along with GPT-4.

The article reviews the development trends of generative AI over the past year and puts forward the viewpoint that generative AI is moving from the "first act" to the "second act," where hype and rapid demonstrations are being replaced by real value and complete product experiences. As a result, they have updated their market map of generative AI.

One year ago, they proposed a hypothesis that generative AI would become a profound platform transformation in the technology field, and now it seems that this transformation is well underway.

The first year of generative AI, referred to as the "first act," was more technology-driven. It saw the emergence of new basic models and a wave of lightweight tech-demo applications.

Now, they believe the market is entering the "second act," which will be more customer-driven. The second act aims to solve human problems end-to-end, and these applications differ fundamentally from the initial wave of applications. They often incorporate basic models as part of a more comprehensive solution, introduce new editing interfaces to enhance workflow and output quality, and are frequently multimodal.

The article provides examples of companies entering the second act, such as Harvey, Glean, Character, and Ava, which are customizing generative AI for specific use cases like legal research, workspace indexing, and digital companions.

The authors also share an updated market map for generative AI, organized by use cases rather than model modality, reflecting the evolving nature of generative AI applications.

The article revisits their previous predictions, highlighting areas where their forecasts were correct and where they underestimated the pace of development in the generative AI space. It discusses how competition has intensified and how user engagement and retention are key challenges for generative AI applications.

In the second act, founders are focusing on improving their AI products, developing shared technical scripts to make models more useful, and introducing new user interfaces and experiences. The article also mentions the importance of developer-centric approaches and the evolution of generative AI applications from individual tasks to system-level productivity.

In conclusion, the article acknowledges that while generative AI has shown tremendous promise, there are still challenges to address, particularly in proving long-term value to users. The authors express confidence in the future of generative AI and are optimistic about the second act, where they expect founders to continue pushing the boundaries of model performance and product experiences.

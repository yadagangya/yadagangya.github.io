### Legendary Game Developer John Carmack: General Artificial Intelligence Could Emerge by 2030

**Description**: According to IT Home's report on September 26th, legendary game developer John Carmack believes that general artificial intelligence (AGI) could potentially emerge around 2030. Carmack shared his views during an event for his AGI startup company Keen, where they announced the hiring of Richard Sutton, Chief Scientific Advisor at the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute. Carmack referred to Sutton as the "father of reinforcement learning" and said he's well-suited to lead AGI workâ€”a form of artificial intelligence that approximates human behavior. Sutton mentioned that he doesn't believe writing AGI with existing technology is infeasible and suggested that by 2030, a "proto-AI might show signs of life." Keen's team is relatively small compared to larger AI organizations with billions of dollars and hundreds of employees, and they've secured only $20 million in funding. However, Sutton and the Keen team are bold enough to believe they can make contributions to AGI. John Carmack is a prominent American video game programmer, co-founder of id Software, and the developer of the famous first-person shooter game "Doom."

SHEIN, a popular online shopping platform, has announced a platform upgrade with a strong emphasis on expanding its product categories while maintaining a focus on fashion. This upgrade reflects SHEIN's commitment to providing a wider range of offerings to its customers while continuing to prioritize the latest fashion trends. The expansion into new product categories aims to enhance the overall shopping experience for users and meet a broader array of consumer needs.


On September 19th, SHEIN hosted a strategic conference for attracting merchants in Shenzhen. This marked SHEIN's first large-scale platform-oriented merchant recruitment event.

The conference was highly significant for SHEIN, with several high-ranking executives in attendance, including Molly, responsible for merchant recruitment across all product categories. There were rumors that COO Miaomiao made an appearance at the conference, sparking extensive discussions within the industry.

The conference had several highlights. Specifically, SHEIN emphasized the deepening of its platformization, which includes both operational agency and independent operations models. Under the operational agency model, SHEIN provides comprehensive support and services, including product management, warehousing, logistics, customer service, and after-sales support. Concerning the independent operations model, sellers can manage their product selection, listing, marketing strategies, sales, inventory, and logistics independently. SHEIN proposed to leverage platform resources and brand influence to support brand development.

In terms of specific product categories, SHEIN highlighted its "Fashion-Centric" strategy and focused on six key categories, including home, beauty, men's fashion, children's fashion, 3C electronics, and footwear and accessories/jewelry. For instance, in the home category, makeup tables have become a hit product on the SHEIN platform, catering to the preferences of female users.

SHEIN has already attracted numerous brands to join its platform, including international brands like ANKE and ZhioHome, as well as domestic brands like Elmupo and Jueduo. To accelerate platformization, SHEIN plans to support ten thousand sellers worldwide in achieving annual sales of one million dollars within the next three years and help one hundred thousand small and medium-sized sellers achieve annual sales of one hundred thousand dollars. They have also announced the National 500 City Industrial Belt Program.

During the conference, SHEIN provided multiple examples of applying the "flexible supply chain" to other sectors.

For instance, XinHai Ceramics, with seventeen years of history, joined SHEIN in 2019. Starting with imitation products and then receiving feedback from buyers for targeted development, XinHai Ceramics adjusted its operations based on SHEIN platform users' preferences for color and style. In 2022, XinHai Ceramics experienced rapid growth on SHEIN, with procurement amounts doubling from an average of 2 million USD per month to 4 million USD.

In 2019, an individual from the education sector switched to the foreign trade business for manicures. After joining SHEIN in 2022, within just one year, their turnover increased from an initial monthly sales of ten thousand USD to 1.1 million USD, marking a 6767% annual growth. Their strategy involved initially listing 10-100 test items, identifying trending products, and then proceeding with independent mold creation and production.

In 2022, a post-95s entrepreneur, Zhou Yunbin, started selling resin ornaments as a self-operated category on SHEIN. With guidance from SHEIN buyers, he successfully listed over 500 SKUs, increasing his daily turnover from slightly over 2,000 USD to more than 400 times that amount. This achievement was primarily due to the "small order, fast response" strategy, which involved adjusting production based on market feedback. Later, he invested in building a factory to enhance production flexibility, enabling rapid responses to unexpected large orders.

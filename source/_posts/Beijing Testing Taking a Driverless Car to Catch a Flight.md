In a move towards advanced transportation systems, Beijing is conducting an internal testing phase where passengers can use driverless cars to reach the airport for their flights. This innovative approach aims to streamline the travel experience by integrating autonomous vehicles into the airport transportation network.

The concept involves passengers scheduling a driverless car to pick them up from their location and transport them to the airport terminal. Here's how the process generally works:

1. **Booking:** Passengers can book a driverless car using a designated app or platform. They provide their location, flight details, and any special requirements.

2. **Vehicle Dispatch:** Once the booking is confirmed, an autonomous vehicle is dispatched to the passenger's location at the specified time.

3. **Autonomous Ride:** Passengers embark on a driverless journey to the airport. During the ride, they can relax or prepare for their flight, as the vehicle navigates the route autonomously.

4. **Airport Arrival:** The driverless car arrives at the airport terminal, where passengers can proceed with their check-in and other pre-flight procedures.

This initiative aims to enhance convenience and efficiency for travelers, reduce traffic congestion, and promote the adoption of autonomous transportation technologies. However, it is important to ensure the safety and reliability of these autonomous systems before widespread implementation.

Beijing's internal testing phase will likely involve rigorous testing of the driverless vehicles, including their ability to handle complex urban traffic conditions and provide a smooth and secure journey for passengers. If successful, this innovative transportation solution could become a model for future airport access systems in cities around the world.



"In Beijing, You Can Now Take a Driverless Car to the Airport"

Following the example set by Wuhan, Beijing has also opened up testing for driverless car services connecting the city to the airport. The first batch of companies involved includes Xiaoma Zhixing and Baidu, and the service currently covers the route between Daxing Airport and the Economic Development Zone.

Whether it's taking a driverless car to the airport or getting picked up by one, it has now become a reality in Beijing.

Recently, Beijing announced the commencement of internal testing for autonomous driving services connecting the city center to the airport.

As a result, Beijing has become the second city in China to open such a city-to-airport testing route and the first capital city in the world to do so.

The companies approved for testing are none other than Baidu and Xiaoma Zhixing.

The test route primarily covers highway scenarios, connecting the city center and spanning approximately 40 kilometers. It includes three segments:

1. The Beijing section of the Beijing-Taiwan Highway (from Xingyilu to the northern section of Daxing Airport Expressway).
2. The northern section of Daxing Airport Expressway (from the Beijing section of the Beijing-Taiwan Highway to the Daxing Airport Expressway's northern boundary).
3. Daxing Airport Expressway (from the northern section of Daxing Airport Expressway to the northern boundary of Beijing Daxing International Airport).

According to Xiaoma Zhixing, this testing phase has opened up over 600 stations in Beijing's Economic Development Zone for road tests between the Economic Development Zone and Daxing Airport Terminal. At this stage, safety personnel are present in the vehicles.

While this service is still in the testing phase, with increasing usage and accumulated mileage, it is expected to evolve into a fully autonomous, paid operation between the airport and the city center.

Moreover, during the recent World Intelligent Connected Vehicles Conference, Baidu's RoboTaxi and Xiaoma Zhixing offered driverless car services to and from the airport. The route extended from Beijing Capital Airport Terminal 3 to the main venue of the China International Exhibition Center, covering a one-way distance of approximately 8.3 kilometers and a round trip of about 17.2 kilometers.

It's worth noting that both Xiaoma Zhixing and Baidu were granted permission not long ago to conduct fully autonomous commercial operations in Beijing. This city-to-airport route represents a significant step forward in the deployment of commercial autonomous driving services.

Beijing has made rapid progress in its high-level autonomous driving demonstration zone since its establishment.

In the first half of this year, Xiaoma Zhixing and Baidu's RoboTaxi became the first batch of companies authorized to conduct fully autonomous driving demonstration applications in Beijing's Yizhuang Economic Development Zone.

In the 60-square-kilometer area of Yizhuang Economic Development Zone in Beijing, both companies have officially launched paid autonomous car services. Using the PonyPilot+ or RoboTaxi app, users can hail autonomous cars to various destinations, including subway stations, shopping districts, parks, and residential areas.

Over the course of more than a year, these two companies have transitioned from having safety personnel on board to operating without them. Now, they are exploring operational routes that connect highways and urban areas.

Furthermore, Beijing will continue to promote the commercialization of autonomous driving. One important task for this year is to expand the construction of the high-level autonomous driving demonstration zone, which has been included in Beijing's "Key Tasks for 2023" report. The plan is to expand the existing 60-square-kilometer zone to cover the entire city, encompassing 500 square kilometers, advancing the high-level autonomous driving demonstration zone to its 3.0 phase.

This plan includes full autonomous, paid passenger operations, as well as the establishment of a route for autonomous cars between the Economic Development Zone and the airport, which is part of the implementation plan.

Additionally, train stations are also one of the important scenes for the planned introduction of autonomous car connections. So, in the future, you'll not only be able to take a driverless car to the airport but also to the train station.

The deployment of autonomous cleaning vehicles and the commercialization of logistics on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei trunk line are also in the planning stages.

Furthermore, Shunyi District will be incorporated into Beijing's high-level autonomous driving demonstration zone.

Apart from autonomous car operations, autonomous delivery vehicles are also a crucial application for the deployment of autonomous driving in Beijing. Shunyi District has formulated corresponding management measures for this purpose.

From fully autonomous, paid passenger operations to taking a driverless car to the airport and implementing autonomous delivery of goods and takeout, the future seems promising for autonomous driving in Beijing, often referred to as the "Beijing Model" for its pioneering approach.

In addition to these developments, Xiaoma Zhixing has obtained a municipal-level license for autonomous car operations in Shenzhen. This means that from 8:30 AM to 10:30 PM, you can hail Xiaoma Zhixing's fully autonomous cars in the Qianhai area of Shenzhen, and these cars will have no safety personnel on board.

Following Beijing and Guangzhou, Xiaoma Zhixing's fully autonomous driving service has expanded to another city.

The next city to open up to such services, who knows?

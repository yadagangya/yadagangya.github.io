The research suggests that the carbon emissions associated with AI-generated paintings are only about 1/2900th of those produced by human artists. This finding was shared by Yann LeCun, a prominent figure in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, indicating his interest and endorsement of the research.

The environmental impact of creative processes, including traditional art forms, has become a subject of concern in recent years. Creating art often involves the use of various materials, which can lead to carbon emissions, particularly in the case of physical artwork production. However, the emergence of AI-generated art has raised questions about its environmental footprint compared to traditional artistic practices.

The research findings suggest that AI-generated art, which relies on computational processes and digital media, is significantly more eco-friendly in terms of carbon emissions. This reduced environmental impact could be attributed to the efficiency of AI algorithms and the absence of physical materials typically associated with traditional art.

Yann LeCun's interest in and endorsement of this research highlight the importance of considering environmental sustainability in the development and application of artificial intelligence technologies. As AI continues to advance and be integrated into various industries, including the arts, understanding and minimizing its environmental footprint can contribute to more responsible and sustainable AI practices.



The research suggests that the carbon emissions associated with AI-generated writing and art creation are significantly lower than those produced by humans. According to a paper shared by Yann LeCun, the emissions from AI-generated content are approximately 1/2900th of the emissions generated by human writers and artists.

The research compared the carbon emissions of AI models, including ChatGPT, BLOOM, DALL-E2, and Midjourney, with those of human writers and artists. The study considered two main sources of carbon emissions: training emissions and query emissions for AI models, and emissions associated with human activities like writing or drawing.

For AI models, training emissions were calculated based on the amount of carbon emitted during the training process. This was then divided across the queries made to the model. For example, GPT-3's training was estimated to produce about 552 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, and BLOOM's training emitted about 30 tons. Query emissions were estimated based on the model's daily usage and the number of queries it responded to.

For human writing, carbon emissions were calculated based on factors such as the average speed of writing, the electricity used by computers, and the average carbon footprint of individuals in the United States and India. The calculations considered the time it takes to write a page of text or create an illustration.

The results of the study showed that AI-generated writing and art creation had significantly lower carbon emissions compared to their human counterparts, even when accounting for the energy used by computers. The research acknowledges certain limitations, such as not all tasks being suitable for AI intervention and potential social impacts, but it highlights the environmental advantages of AI in certain creative tasks.

While the study's methodology has been questioned by some, it has sparked discussions about the environmental impact of AI and its potential advantages in reducing carbon emissions in creative fields. It's important to note that the research provides a starting point for exploring the environmental aspects of AI in creative work and raises awareness about the topic.

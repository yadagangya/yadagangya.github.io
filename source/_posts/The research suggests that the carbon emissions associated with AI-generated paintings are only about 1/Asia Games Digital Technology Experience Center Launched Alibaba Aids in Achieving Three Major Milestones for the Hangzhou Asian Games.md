The Hangzhou Asian Games has seen the launch of the Asia Games Digital Technology Experience Center, a significant step toward realizing three major breakthroughs with the assistance of Alibaba.



On September 19th, the Hangzhou Asian Games launched the Asia Games Digital Technology Experience Center, and IIario Corna, Chief Information Technology Officer of the International Olympic Committee, stated during the opening ceremony that the Hangzhou Asian Games had made history, laying a solid foundation for the digitalization of major sporting events.

As an official partner of the Hangzhou Asian Games, Alibaba has provided digital services for this edition of the Asian Games, focusing on "Smart Asian Games" and "Green Asian Games," achieving three major milestones in the history of the Asian Games: the first-ever comprehensive cloud deployment of the Asian Games' core systems, the creation of the first "Cloud Asian Games Village," and the introduction of the first low-carbon account system for the Asian Games Village.

Alibaba Group's President, Ben Hang, explained that technological advancements have continually added luster to the Hangzhou Asian Games. Alibaba has utilized AI and smart technology to provide richer, greener, and more efficient services to all Asian Games participants.

The First Asian Games with a Core System Fully on the Cloud

During this edition of the Asian Games, Alibaba Cloud made history by making it the first Asian Games where the core systems were 100% on the cloud. Hangzhou Asian Games also became the first Asian Games to use cloud broadcasting technology. The cloud broadcasting center, built at the event venue, utilizes Alibaba Cloud's Cloud Enterprise Network (CEN) and video broadcasting technologies. This setup ensures that broadcasters can receive real-time event content and establish their content creation, management, and distribution systems. The content is broadcasted in real-time to viewers worldwide via Alibaba Cloud's data centers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Mumbai, and other locations.

Cloud broadcasting technology brings ultra-high definition, low latency, and low construction costs to broadcasting. This allows spectators to watch each game from closer distances and multiple angles.

Cloud technology is also integrated into the daily work of the Asian Games Organizing Committee. Hangzhou Asian Games partnered with DingTalk to launch the "Asian Games Ding" platform, a comprehensive intelligent event management platform for large-scale sports events. By August 2023, "Asian Games Ding" had integrated 293 applications, with more than 200,000 messages sent in a single day and nearly 500 online meetings conducted, playing a crucial role in the Asian Games test events and full-scale rehearsals.

The First "Cloud Asian Games Village" - Alibaba Creates a Model of Smart Future Communities

The Hangzhou Asian Games this year is one of the few to have combined three villages (athlete village, official village, and media village) into one, expected to accommodate 20,000 athletes and over 10,000 staff and volunteers, making it the largest and most challenging in terms of operation in Asian Games history.

To address this challenge, the Hangzhou Asian Games Organizing Committee, the Hangzhou Asian Games Village, and Alibaba Group jointly created the first "Cloud Asian Games Village." On September 18th, the "Cloud Asian Games Village" was officially opened. It serves as the "brain" of the Asian Games Village, utilizing Alibaba's platform for intelligent decision-making. The system integrates data from more than 20 systems and about 440 data indicators covering real-time operational data in six areas: people, items, venues, security, services, and low-carbon. This data provides real-time information and intelligent decision support for the managers of the Asian Games Village.

The "Cloud Asian Games Village" simplifies life for its residents. For example, if the air conditioning in a room is not working, residents can use the "Cloud Communication" mini-program on their mobile phones to report the issue. They simply fill in the room address and description and click "Report." A work order is immediately generated for maintenance personnel to respond to. From taking the request, dispatching it, completing the maintenance, to closing the work order, everything is organized and efficient.

Additionally, residents can easily book services like the fitness center or massage parlor and access information about the canteen's menu and crowd levels, all through their smartphones.

Sun Xudong, the Executive Commander of the Hangzhou Asian Games Village and Deputy Mayor of Hangzhou, said that the "Cloud Asian Games Village" is a key aspect of the Hangzhou Asian Games' intelligent event management. The collaboration with Alibaba Group allows the village's digitalization, providing real-time data, and intelligent decision support. This reduces the need for manpower in village operations while improving the experience for residents. The digital operating model of the "Cloud Asian Games Village" also provides a model for future communities in China.

The First Low-Carbon Account for an Asian Games Village - Making the Asian Games More Sustainable

Actions like "Clean Plate," green transportation, plastic-free shopping, etc., have accumulated carbon points that can be exchanged for low-carbon Asian Games mascot gifts and can also be donated, leaving a low-carbon footprint for the Hangzhou Asian Games. A greener Asian Games Village has also been a highlight of this edition of the Asian Games.

The "Asian Games Village Low-Carbon Account," developed jointly by the Asian Games Organizing Committee and Alibaba Group, is the first carbon account in the history of the Asian Games. By intelligently and interactively connecting the life scenarios of the village residents, such as eating, using, and traveling, it promotes a low-carbon lifestyle.

As part of the traditional "badge exchange" at major sporting events, the Hangzhou Asian Games Village opted for low-carbon alternatives. Each Alibaba badge is made from environmentally friendly and low-carbon materials, with four of them being zero-carbon badges. Athletes exchange not only culture but also green goodwill.

A representative from the Hangzhou Asian Games Organizing Committee's Environmental Protection Department stated that the "Asian Games Village Low-Carbon Account" is an innovation for the Hangzhou Asian Games in terms of promoting a green and low-carbon lifestyle. It enriches the lives of residents and allows them to participate in and experience a green Asian Games. It provides a good example for future large-scale sporting events in China and abroad on how to host environmentally friendly games.

Please note that some of the terms used, such as "Asian Games," refer to the Hangzhou Asian Games, and may not be the same as the term "Asian Games" in English, which refers to a broader multi-sport event.

Tencent Healthcare: More Than Just Large Models

While many companies are diving into the AI big model craze this year, Tencent Health is taking a different path. In the remote southwestern region of Qiannan in Guizhou Province, China, Tencent Health is deeply involved in remote healthcare, establishing a tiered healthcare system that spans five levels of administrative regions. In the domain of medical and pharmaceutical distribution, they are focusing on cost reduction, efficiency enhancement, and transparent regulations by establishing a digital chain with IoT partners. Furthermore, as traditional Chinese medical equipment giants transition, Tencent Health is integrating AI technology and big data advantages into in-vitro diagnostics, bringing intelligence into clinical practice.

Some voices argue that Tencent Health's story lacks novelty. While everyone else is busy with AI big models, they are addressing the "stagnation" in the healthcare industry in collaboration with partners.

Does Tencent Health not feel the pressure?

Tencent Health's President, Wu Wendai, made it clear in a conversation with Leiphone that they are excited about using new technologies like AI big models. However, he also emphasized that Tencent, as a whole, maintains a relatively restrained approach toward big models. They are more focused on how to use these big models effectively in real-world medical scenarios.

For instance, when it comes to hospitals, data privacy is a significant concern. Tencent Health could encapsulate their large medical models with billions of parameters for local deployment in hospitals, but this would require substantial funding and human resources. Many hospitals might not afford these costs. Even if they can afford them, other practical constraints exist, such as difficulties in recruiting and retaining high-quality data science staff and covering maintenance expenses.

Tencent Health has chosen a different path: they encapsulate big models, a production tool, within various business and product offerings and then deliver them to independent software vendors (ISVs) and other partners.

As demonstrated last year when Tencent shifted its strategy from being an "integrator" to being "integrated" at the group level, they now let partners take the lead in directly serving customers, with Tencent's in-house product capabilities embedded as part of comprehensive solutions.

After a year of practice, Tencent still puts partners in the spotlight. In return, Tencent Health strives for excellence in interaction experiences and exploring scenarios.

Tencent's ambitions in the medical field are evident, and they are willing to invest the effort and resources to realize them.

Unveiling the Tencent Medical Big Model

The journey from traditional AI, represented by deep learning, to medical big models, represents a transformation in how AI can serve healthcare.

Not long ago, when discussing medical big models, a chief physician from a top-tier hospital mentioned two fundamental limitations: humans hold medical big models to stricter error tolerance standards than they do for themselves, and humans cannot hold medical big models accountable.

This means that when building foundational and industry-specific big models, companies must be exceptionally well-prepared, following the standards of "technical foundation," "range extender," and "change one's own destiny."

On September 8, Tencent Health officially announced the creation of a dedicated big model for the medical industry based on Tencent's in-house developed "Hunyuan Universal Big Model." This specialized big model includes vast amounts of medical data, such as medical literature in both Chinese and English, encyclopedias, drug instructions, and articles written and reviewed by medical experts from Tencent Medipedia. This model serves as the foundation, with over 100 billion parameters and pre-training on more than 200 trillion tokens of medical text data.

In the next step, Tencent Health added knowledge graphs accumulated over the years by its Tianyan Laboratory. These structured data contain 2.85 million medical entities and 12.5 million medical relationships, among other structured information. This knowledge graph has nearly 98% coverage of medical knowledge and enhances the model's medical expertise.

Tencent Health also incorporated training data in a "question-answer" format to refine the model's conversational abilities. This data comes from various sources, including patient scenarios, doctor scenarios, and pharmaceutical knowledge databases, totaling approximately 30 million question-answer pairs.

In the final step, human experts were involved in reinforcement learning training to increase the diversity of model-generated responses. They scored the generated answers based on accuracy, patient care, and other criteria, with the data from 360,000 expert-scored question-answer pairs being used to train a reward model. This reinforcement learning mechanism was integrated into the big model.

The result is a medical big model capable of generating responses, intelligent question answering, structured medical record generation and retrieval, imaging report assistance, and diagnostic support. It can be embedded throughout the healthcare process.

The Tencent Health Big Model in Action

In real-world healthcare scenarios, Tencent's big model finds a range of applications, including generating medical content, intelligent question answering, structuring and retrieving medical records, generating imaging reports, and assisting with diagnostics. It can be integrated into various stages of healthcare.

Imagine a hospital with a daily patient volume exceeding 50,000. When doctors are busy or off-duty, an "AI nurse" can provide round-the-clock answers to questions, guide patients to seek appropriate care, and generate more accurate medical records, reducing the administrative burden on healthcare professionals. This allows medical staff to focus more on patient care, improving overall satisfaction.

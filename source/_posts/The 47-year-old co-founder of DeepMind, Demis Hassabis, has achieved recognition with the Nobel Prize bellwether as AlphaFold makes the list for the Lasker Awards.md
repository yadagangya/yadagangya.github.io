The 47-year-old co-founder of DeepMind, Demis Hassabis, has achieved recognition with the "Nobel Prize bellwether" as AlphaFold makes the list for the Lasker Awards.

The Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Awards, often referred to as the "American Nobels," are prestigious honors in the field of medical research. AlphaFold, developed by DeepMind, has gained recognition for its groundbreaking work in protein folding prediction, a critical aspect of understanding various diseases and developing new drugs.

This recognition underlines the importance of AlphaFold's contributions to scientific research, as it has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery and our understanding of numerous medical conditions. Demis Hassabis and the DeepMind team have made significant strides in advancing artificial intelligence for scientific purposes, and their work continues to garner attention and accolades within the scientific community.


Just recently, the Lasker Awards, often considered a bellwether for the Nobel Prize, announced its 2023 winners!

Among the awardees are the two inventors of AlphaFold, CEO Demis Hassabis and first author John Jumper from Google DeepMind. They jointly received the Basic Medical Research Award.

This isn't their first time receiving recognition together. Last year, they also won the Breakthrough Prizes, often dubbed the "Oscars of Science."

In total, the Lasker Awards established three major categories this year with six awardees: Basic Medical Research Award, Clinical Medical Research Award, and Medical Science Special Achievement Award.

Apart from Hassabis and Jumper's Basic Medical Research Award, the Clinical Medical Research Award went to three OCT researchers. The Medical Science Special Achievement Award was presented to Piet Borst from the Netherlands Cancer Institute.

Each award comes with a prize of $250,000.

The 2023 Awardees are as follows:

Basic Medical Research Award:
Awardees:
- Demis Hassabis (Google DeepMind)
- John Jumper (Google DeepMind)

Reason for Award: They invented the revolutionary technology, AlphaFold, for predicting the three-dimensional structure of proteins. AlphaFold has successfully addressed the long-standing challenge of predicting the three-dimensional structure of proteins from their one-dimensional amino acid sequences. Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, through their outstanding ideas, intensive efforts, and exceptional engineering skills, have led the AlphaFold team to unprecedented levels of accuracy and speed in structure prediction. This transformative approach is rapidly advancing our understanding of fundamental biological processes and aiding drug design.

In 2018, AlphaFold was introduced by DeepMind, capable of predicting the 3D structure of proteins solely based on their genetic sequences, and its results were more accurate than any previous models. During its debut at the 13th Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) competition, it successfully predicted the most accurate structures for 25 out of 43 proteins, surpassing 97 other competitors. Building upon the original version, AlphaFold2 was introduced in 2020, which has achieved remarkable success in solving the protein folding problem. The accuracy of AlphaFold2 improved from an initial score of 60+/100 to 92.4/100, a significant breakthrough compared to previous methods that hovered around 40 points.

Demis Hassabis, aged 47, co-founded DeepMind and currently serves as the CEO of Google DeepMind. He grew up in London, and from a young age, he was known as a "chess prodigy." By the age of 13, he reached the level of a chess master with an Elo rating of 2300. At 17, he created the highly successful simulation game "Theme Park," which sold millions of copies. Hassabis completed his undergraduate studies in computer science with a double first-class degree at the University of Cambridge. He later earned a Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience at University College London and pursued postdoctoral research at MIT and Harvard.

In 2010, Hassabis co-founded DeepMind with Shane Legg and Mustafa Suleyman, with a mission to "solve intelligence and then use that to solve everything else." Following the development of the highly acclaimed Go-playing AI, AlphaGo, in 2018, Hassabis led the research on AlphaFold.

John Jumper, another recipient of the Basic Medical Research Award, is the first author of AlphaFold and a core member of the team. Jumper obtained his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, focusing on using machine learning to simulate protein folding and dynamics. He serves as a Senior Research Scientist at DeepMind Technologies and was listed among Nature's Top Ten "people who mattered" in 2021.

Clinical Medical Research Award:
Awardees:
- James G. Fujimoto (MIT)
- David Huang (Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health & Science University)
- Eric A. Swanson (MIT)

Reason for Award: They invented Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a technology that has transformed ophthalmology by enabling rapid detection of retinal diseases that impair vision. OCT uses light beams to visualize the microscopic structures within bodily tissues, such as the retina. The ability to generate high-resolution cross-sectional images of the interior of the eye in real-time without physical contact has been unprecedented. OCT has revolutionized ophthalmology by allowing doctors to quickly detect and treat sight-threatening retinal diseases, ultimately saving the vision of millions of people. The medical applications of OCT are expanding, especially as engineers have integrated it into probes that can enter the circulatory system and incorporated it into surgical microscopes and other instruments.

Medical Science Special Achievement Award:
Awardee: Piet Borst (Netherlands Cancer Institute)

Reason for Award: He is honored for his outstanding scientific discoveries, guidance, and leadership over 50 years. In the laboratory, Piet Borst ventured boldly into new areas repeatedly, making pioneering discoveries in multiple fields. His work unveiled how parasites evade the human immune system and provided insights into the molecular pumps underlying cancer drug resistance. He elucidated an unexpected metabolic pathway, revealed a novel DNA building block, and identified the biochemical basis of genetic diseases. With foresight and determination, he led the Netherlands Cancer Institute to international prominence. His contributions extended far beyond his homeland as he guided prominent scientific organizations and award committees in Europe and other regions. He mentored dozens of internationally renowned investigators, and his passion for science and commitment to public education were unwavering.

Lasker Awards:
In the fields of physiology and medicine, the Lasker Awards are considered one of the top honors, often seen as a precursor to the Nobel Prize. Named after early medical researcher Emil von Behring, the Lasker Awards aim to reward scientists who have made outstanding contributions to basic medical research. Initially, the award was divided into Basic Medical Research Award, Clinical Medical Research Award, and Public Service Award, and later added a Special Achievement Award.

Since 1945, the Lasker Awards have been presented annually, with more than 300 individuals receiving the honor to date. The Lasker Awards are sometimes referred to as the "American Nobels" because over 80 Lasker laureates have gone on to win Nobel Prizes.

In summary, while this year's Lasker Awards did not recognize any research specifically in the field of biology, AlphaFold's technology has clearly made a significant impact on the scientific community.

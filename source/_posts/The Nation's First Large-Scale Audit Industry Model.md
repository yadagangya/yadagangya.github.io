### Wang Xiao Chuan Claims China's Large Models Have a Chance to Surpass the United States

**Description**: According to Phoenix Finance, on September 27, Wang Xiao Chuan, founder and CEO of Baichuan Intelligence, delivered a keynote speech titled "Looking Ahead to the Era of AI Large Models." Regarding the gap and development path between China's large model products and OpenAI's ChatGPT, Wang Xiao Chuan stated that in terms of ideology, we are half a step behind American giants. He then proposed the concept of "one step slower in ideology but three steps faster in implementation." Wang Xiao Chuan said that compared to the United States, we are lagging behind in "landing," but we have not been completely left behind. In addition to catching up, our efforts should be focused on faster implementation, enhancing search, reinforcement learning, domain expertise, and application development, rather than panicking or admiring how to catch up with the United States. We have the opportunity to lead in applications. Wang Xiao Chuan mentioned in his on-site speech, "At the beginning of the year, everyone was very panicked and felt that the gap between us and the United States was very large, but as of now, we have not fallen behind. By the end of this year, Baichuan and several other companies can achieve preliminary capabilities for 3.5 AGI, but there is still a huge gap between us and OpenAI for versions 4.0 and 5.0."
